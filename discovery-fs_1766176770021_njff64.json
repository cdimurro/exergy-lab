            "abstract": "The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with anchoring groups was considered as an effective approach for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells with metal oxide charge transporting layers. However, the coating of SAM layers in PSMs by means of a slot-die is a challenging process due to the low viscosity of the solutions and the low wettability of the films. In this study, we integrate a triphenylamine-based polymer, pTPA-TDP, blended with SAM based on 5-[4-[4-(diphenylamino) phenyl] thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (TPATC), to address the challenges of uniform slot-die coating and interface passivation in large-area modules. We fabricated p-i-n oriented PSMs on 50x50 mm2 substrates (12-sub-cells) with NiO hole transport layer (HTL) and organic interlayers for surface modification. Wetting angle mapping demonstrated that ununiform regions of the slot-die coated SAM have hydrophobicity with contact angle values up to 90°, causing fluctuations in absorber thickness and the presence of macro-defects at buried interfaces. The incorporation of the blended interlayer to NiO/perovskite junction homogenized the surface wettability (contact angle=40°) and mitigated lattice strain in the absorber. This enabled the effective use of SAM properties on a large-area surface, improving energy level alignment and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the modules from 13.98% to 15.83% and stability (ISOS-L-2, T80 period) from 500-1000 hours to 1630 hours. Investigation of PSMs upon cooling till -5 °C showed that the PCE increased by +0.19%/°C for samples with NiO HTL, while using SAM and blended interlayers raised the coefficient to ~0.40%/°C due to changes in activation energy and trap contributions to device performance across a wide temperature range.",

In this work, the reactive ion-beam sputtering of nickel oxide has been developed for the hole transporting layer of a p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PCSs). The process is carried out by oxidation of the scattered Ni particles with additional post-treatment annealing regimes. Using deposition rate of 1.2 nm/min allowed growth of very uniform NiO coating with the roughness below 0.5 nm on polished Si wafer (15x15 cm2). We performed a complex investigation of structural, optical, surface and electrical properties of the NiO thin-films. The post-treatment annealing (150-300C) was considered as an essential process for improvement of the optical transparency, decrease of defects concentration and gain of the charge carrier mobility. As result, the annealed ion-beam sputtered NiO films delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 20.14%, while device without post-treatment reached the value of 11.84%. The improvement of the output performance originated from an increase of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), shunt and contact properties in the devices. We also demonstrate that the ion-beam sputtering of NiO can be successfully implemented for the fabrication of large area modules (54.5 cm2) and PSCs on a flexible plastic substrate (125 microns).",

We present a unique comprehensive confinement study of PSCs with TPATC as the self-assembled HTM, including analysis of numerical defect parameters, phase composition evolution, and up-scaling capabilities. Our investigation shows that the ultrathin TPATC interlayer effectively passivates traps, increases work-function of HTL by about ~0.2 eV, and enhances the charge carrier extraction efficiency. Advanced transient spectroscopy measurements revealed that modification of the NiO surface with TPATC in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reduces the concentration of ionic defects by an order of magnitude. Interface engineering with TPATC allowed to reach power conversion efficiency of 20.58% for small area devices (0.15 cm2) under standard AM 1.5 G conditions. Using TPATC interlayer also provided stabilized performance of PSCs under operation conditions and improved sustainability of the perovskite absorber to decomposition. After continuous light-soaking (1000 h, ISOS-L-2 protocol), NiO/TPATC devices showed a slight decrease of 2% in maximum power. In contrast, NiO PSCs demonstrated decrease in power output (&gt;20%) after 400 h. We explored the potential of TPATC to modify interfaces in large-area perovskite solar modules (PSM, active area-64.8 cm2, 12 sub-cells). By applying slot-die-coated TPATC, the PCE at AM 1.5 G conditions increased from 13.22% for NiO PSM to 15.64% for NiO/TPATC ones. This study provides new insights into the interface engineering for p-i-n perovskite solar cells, behavior of the ionic defects and their contribution to the long-term stability.",

Recently, MXenes-2D structured transition metal carbides and nitrides with various functionalization (=O,-F,-OH) demonstrated high potential for mastering the work function in halide perovskite absorbers and significantly improved the n-type charge collection in solar cells. This work demonstrates that MXenes allow for efficient stabilization of perovskite solar cells besides improving their performances. We introduce a new mixed composite bathocuproine:MXene, i.e., (BCP:MXene) interlayer at the interface between an electron-transport layer (ETL) and a metal cathode in the p-in device structure. Our investigation demonstrates that the use of BCP:MXene interlayer slightly increases the power conversation efficiency (PCE) for PSCs (from 16.5 for reference to 17.5%) but dramatically improves the out of Glove-Box stability.

Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the Sun, whereas shocks driven by solar disturbances are observed to accelerate energetic storm particles (ESPs). Moreover, a dilute population with a distinct composition forms the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) which are of a mixed interstellar-heliospheric origin. Particles are also accelerated at planetary bow shocks. We will present recent observations of energetic particles by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, as well as other spacecraft that allow us to study the acceleration and transport of energetic particles at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere.",

Due to their large work function, the hole collection mechanism of such solar cells are fundamentally different from other materials like PEDOT: PSS, and the associated device optimizations are not well elucidated. In addition, the prospects of such architectures against the challenges posed by ion migration are yet to be explored - which we critically examine in this contribution through detailed numerical simulations. Curiously, we find that, for similar ion densities and interface recombination velocities, ion migration is more detrimental for Perovskite solar cells with TMO contact layers with much lower achievable efficiency limits (21%). The insights shared by this work should be of broad interest to the community in terms of long-term stability, efficiency degradation and hence could help critically evaluate the promises and prospects of TMOs as hole contact layers for perovskite solar cells.",

Among the two widely used perovskite solar cell device architectures of n-ip and p-i-n, the latter is interesting in terms of its simplicity of fabrication and lower energy input. However this structure mostly uses PEDOT:PSS as a hole transporting layer which can accelerate the perovskite solar cell degradation. Hence the development of stable, inorganic hole extraction layers (HEL), without compromising the simplicity of device fabrication is crucial in this fast-growing photovoltaic field. Here we demonstrate a low temperature (~100 oC) solution - processed and ultrathin (~ 6 nm) NiO nanoparticle thin films as an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We measure a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3 % on rigid glass substrates and 8.5 % on flexible substrates. A comparison with PEDOT:PSS based MAPbI3 solar cells (PCE ~ 7.9 %) shows that NiO based solar cells have higher short circuit current density and improved open circuit voltage (1.03V). Apart from the photovoltaic performance under 1 Sun, the efficient hole extraction property of NiO is demonstrated for indoor lighting as well with a PCE of 23.0 % for NiO based CH3NH3PbI2.9Cl0.1 p-i-n solar cells under compact fluorescent lighting. Compared to the perovskite solar cells fabricated on PEDOT:PSS HEL, better shelf-life stability is observed for perovskite solar cells fabricated on NiO HEL. Detailed microstructural and photophysical investigations imply uniform morphology, lower recombination losses, and improved charge transfer properties for CH3NH3PbI3 grown on NiO HEL.",

Through impedance spectroscopy analysis and modelling it is shown that charge accumulation is decreased in the HTL/Perovskite interface, between PEDOT:PSS to Cu:NiOx and CuO respectively. This was indicative from the decrease in double layer capacitance (Cdl) and interfacial charge accumulation capacitance (Cel), resulting in an increase to recombination resistance (Rrec), thus decreased charge recombination events between the three HTLs. Through AFM measurements it is also shown that the reduced recombination events (followed by the increase in Rrec) is also a result of increased grain size between the three HTLs, thus reduction in the grain boundaries area. These charge accumulation properties of the three HTLs have resulted in an increase to the power conversion efficiency between the PEDOT:PSS (8.44%), Cu:NiOx (11.45%) and CuO (15.3%)-based devices.",

By making a simple ansatz for the polarization relaxation, our model is able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively detailed features of measured I-V characteristics. Pre-poling effects are discussed, pointing out the differences between initially over- and under-polarized samples. In particular, the presence of the current over-shoot observed in the reverse characteristics is correlated with the solar cell pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the dynamic hysteresis is analyzed with respect to changing the bias scan rate, the obtained results being consistent with experimentally reported data: the hysteresis amplitude is maximum at intermediate scan rates, while at very slow and very fast ones it becomes negligible. The effects induced by different relaxation time scales are assessed. The proposed dynamic electrical model offers a comprehensive view of the solar cell operation, being a practical tool for future calibration of tentative microscopic descriptions.",

With this technology, the thickness and composition of films can be conveniently and accurately controlled. In the structure of perovskite solar cells, TiO$_2$ layer working as the n-type semiconductor is used to block holes and transport electrons into electrode, which is crucial for the performance of whole devices.

To investigate the specific irradiation damage of 1 MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In and P contents, a simulation based analysis is employed: by fitting the quantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage simultaneously before and after irradiation, the induced changes in lifetime are detected. Furthermore, the reduction of irradiation damage during regeneration under typical satellite operating conditions for GEO missions (60°C and AM0 illumination) is investigated. A clear decrease of the radiation damage is observed after post irradiation regeneration. This regeneration effect is stronger for increasing InP-fraction. It is demonstrated that the irradiation induced defect recombination coefficient for irradiation with 1 MeV electrons after regeneration for 216 hours can be described with a linear function of InP-fraction between 1*10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/s for GaAs and 7*10$^{-7}$ cm$^2$/s for InP.

Such a scheme uses a property that the semiconductor layer with a direct band gap can be better in absorption of long wavelength light and is complementary to the perovskite layer. We studied the semiconducting layers such as GeSe, SnSe, GeS, and SnS, respectively, and found that GeSe is the best, where the optical absorption efficiency in the perovskite/GeSe solar cell is dramatically increased. It turns out that the short circuit current density is enhanced 100% and the power conversion efficiency is promoted 42.7% (to a high value of 23.77%) larger than that in a solar cell with only single perovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency can be further promoted so long as the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are improved.

              "abstract": "The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with anchoring groups was considered as an effective approach for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells with metal oxide charge transporting layers. However, the coating of SAM layers in PSMs by means of a slot-die is a challenging process due to the low viscosity of the solutions and the low wettability of the films. In this study, we integrate a triphenylamine-based polymer, pTPA-TDP, blended with SAM based on 5-[4-[4-(diphenylamino) phenyl] thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (TPATC), to address the challenges of uniform slot-die coating and interface passivation in large-area modules. We fabricated p-i-n oriented PSMs on 50x50 mm2 substrates (12-sub-cells) with NiO hole transport layer (HTL) and organic interlayers for surface modification. Wetting angle mapping demonstrated that ununiform regions of the slot-die coated SAM have hydrophobicity with contact angle values up to 90°, causing fluctuations in absorber thickness and the presence of macro-defects at buried interfaces. The incorporation of the blended interlayer to NiO/perovskite junction homogenized the surface wettability (contact angle=40°) and mitigated lattice strain in the absorber. This enabled the effective use of SAM properties on a large-area surface, improving energy level alignment and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the modules from 13.98% to 15.83% and stability (ISOS-L-2, T80 period) from 500-1000 hours to 1630 hours. Investigation of PSMs upon cooling till -5 °C showed that the PCE increased by +0.19%/°C for samples with NiO HTL, while using SAM and blended interlayers raised the coefficient to ~0.40%/°C due to changes in activation energy and trap contributions to device performance across a wide temperature range.",

This 'spectral tailoring' ensures that nearly 100% of the radiated heat is at an energy level perfectly matched to the PV cell's bandgap, significantly reducing waste heat and enabling grid-scale thermal batteries to achieve round-trip efficiencies exceeding 50%.",

The device must incorporate earth-abundant charge transport layers (such as NiOx and SnO2) and be optimized for slot-die coating on flexible substrates to ensure roll-to-roll (R2R) compatibility. \n\nMethodology & Protocol: \n1. Define the chemical composition of the 2D passivating layer and the slot-die deposition parameters (e.g., ink viscosity, meniscus height, and web speed). \n2. Specify a controlled thermal annealing profile suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. \n3. Detail a vacuum-free encapsulation strategy using flexible barrier films. \n\nMeasurable Success Criteria: \n1. Maintain >80% of initial Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) after 10,000 hours of outdoor operation following ISOS-O-1 protocols. \n2. Achieve a reduction in trap-state density to <10^15 cm^-3, validated via Thermal Admittance Spectroscopy (TAS). \n3. Demonstrate film thickness uniformity with <5% deviation across a 10cm-wide substrate at a processing speed of at least 1 m/min. through systematic analysis of 27 scientific sources. Key findings include: Perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells have achieved a record power conversion efficiency of 33.9% in laboratory settings.; The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar photovoltaics has declined to an average of 0.048 USD/kWh globally.; Next-generation solid-state lithium-metal batteries have demonstrated a specific energy density of 500 Wh/kg..
