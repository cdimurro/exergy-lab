The numerous advantages that increasingly distinguish them from traditional light sources, such as a large and customizable emission area, color tunability, flexibility, and transparency, have positioned them as a promising candidate for various applications in the lighting market, including the residential, automotive, industrial, and agricultural sectors. However, despite these promising attributes, the widespread industrial production of OLEDs encounters significant challenges. Key considerations center around efficiency and lifetime. In the present review, after introducing the theoretical basis of OLEDs and summarizing the main performance developments in the industrial field, three crucial aspects enabling OLEDs to establish a competitive advantage in terms of performance and versatility are critically discussed: the quality and stability of the emitted light, with a specific focus on white light and its tunability; the transparency of both electrodes for the development of fully transparent and integrable devices; and the uniformity of emission over a large area.",

H2 gas is produced from the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where the reaction is catalyzed primarily from Pt-based catalysts under both acidic and alkaline environments. Lowering the loading of Pt and the search for alternative active catalysts for HER is still an ongoing challenge. Two-dimensional MXenes are effective supports to stabilize and homogenously distribute HER-active electrocatalysts to boost the HER performance. Factors involved in the effectiveness of MXenes for their role in HER include transition metal types and termination groups. Recently, tailoring the conditions during the synthesis of MXenes has made it possible to tune the morphology of MXenes from multilayers to few layers (delaminated), formation of porous MXenes, and those with unique crumpled and rolled structures. Changing the morphology of MXenes alters the surface area, exposed active sites and accessibility of electrolyte materials/ions to these active sites. This review provides insight into the effects of varying morphology of MXenes towards the electrocatalytic HER activity of the MXene itself and MXene composites/hybrids with HER-active catalysts. Synthesis methods to obtain the different MXene morphologies are also summarized.",

            "abstract": "Organic-inorganic perovskites have been used as the light absorbing layer in solar cells since 2009 and have since seen a ground breaking rise in efﬁciency in a relatively short period of time. Today, perovskite based solar cells have reached efﬁciencies of over 24% making them a potential competitor to conventional solar cells such as silicon. However, unlike silicon, per-ovskites can essentially be \"printed\" as the layers can all be solution processed and prepared at low temperatures, giving them a huge advantage in terms of cost and process-ability. Nonethe-less, before perovskites are commercially viable, signiﬁcant work must be undertaken to ensure they are ready for mass manufacture. This work was aimed at developing large scale compat-ible (roll-to-roll), ﬂexible perovskite solar cells utilising an Indium doped Tin Oxide (ITO) coated PET substrate. Due to the nature of the substrate, the processing temperatures of each layer had to be low and ideally less than 150 °C. Signiﬁcant work has been undertaken to make perovskite layers roll-to-roll compatible, but the interlayers which it is sandwiched between require further investigation. Therefore, the following work presents the development and ap-plication of a roll-to-roll compatible electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). For the deposition of each layer in a roll-to-roll setting, slot-die coating was employed due to its compatibility with solution deposition and small material wastage. In addition, care was taken to focus on low-toxicity alternatives removing barriers that would otherwise be in place for toxic substances which would hinder large scale manufacturing from a health and safety point of view.",

We demonstrate breakdown voltages exceeding -15 V in typical pin structured perovskite solar cells via two steps: i) using polymer hole transporting materials; ii) using a more electrochemically stable gold electrode. While device degradation can be exacerbated by higher reverse bias and prolonged exposure, our as-fabricated perovskite solar cells completely recover their performance even after stressing at -7 V for 9 hours both in the dark and under partial illumination. Following these observations, we systematically discuss and compare the reverse bias driven degradation pathways in perovskite solar cells with different device architectures. Our model highlights the role of electrochemical reaction rates and species in dictating the reverse bias stability of perovskite solar cells.",

Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of sustainable, fossil-free methods for the large-scale production of fuels and chemicals, with the dual objective of reducing CO2 emissions and providing essential feedstocks for our daily-use products. One promising avenue toward achieving this goal is through the advancement of electrocatalysis, a technology capable of harnessing renewable energy to efficiently convert water into high-value hydrogen. The process of hydrogen evolution via electrocatalysis holds immense potential, albeit often hindered by the prohibitive cost associated with platinum-based catalysts required to drive the reaction at high efficiency. This foundational research introduces a fresh perspective on the electrocatalytic properties of a range of materials, including Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs), CuCo2S4, and Cu2O, shedding light on their advantages and limitations in electrode fabrication. Furthermore, the versatility of these nanomaterials extends beyond hydrogen evolution, encompassing applications such as photocathodes, biosensors, and functional coating layers, opening new avenues for their utilization and potential impact.",

            "abstract": "Orogenic gold deposits in the Superior Province are characteristically hosted in Archean greenstone belts and are fundamentally controlled by their structural environment.The majority of these deposits are recognized as syn-tectonic with the formation of the Superior Province between 2.8-2.6 Ga and are strongly controlled by east-west-striking shear zones.The Island Gold deposit, hosted in the Goudreau Lake Deformation Zone of the Michipicoten greenstone belt, is consistent with this genetic model.Gold deposits occurring in transverse faults at a high angle to these major shear zones have been observed but overlooked in exploration frameworks in the past and as such, the genesis and timing of these deposits are poorly understood.The Maskinonge Lake fault, a late northwest-trending brittle-ductile structure east of the Island Gold deposit, is one of these transverse structures and is populated with zones of high-grade mineralization along its strike.The historic Pine-Breccia gold showing along this fault encompasses 2750-2700 Ma metavolcanic rocks that have undergone pervasive silica alteration.This silicification is structurally associated with the fault and hosts the majority of gold mineralization, suggesting that the Maskinonge Lake fault was a potential conduit for gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.Results of detailed outcrop-scale mapping and structural analyses have led to the recognition of two distinct stages of deformation with opposing sense of shear along a steeply dipping fault plane in a dominantly strike-slip regime.Sinistral movement is documented predominantly by the substantial displacement of stratigraphy and vein array analysis whereas dextral motion is identified by the rotation and ductile drag of felsic dykes and regional ENE-striking shear zones towards a NNW-SSE orientation.The coincidence of fluid infiltration with these events coupled with constraints on mineralization provide more insights into the significance of these structures on a local scale, and the results of this study may be used to aid in future exploration around similar structures that are at a high angle to major east-west shear zones in the Superior Province.",

Harnessing the untapped potential of solar energy sources is crucial for achieving a sustainable future, and accurate MPPT is vital to maximizing power generation. However, existing MPPT algorithms for classical photovoltaic technology lead to suboptimal performance and decreased energy efficiency conversion when applied to the most stable perovskite devices, the so-called triple mesoscopic hole transport material (HTM)-free metal halide PSCs. To address this challenge, our research focuses on developing an innovative low-cost hardware solution for research purposes that enables massive long-term stability measurements, eliminating the need for expensive and complex stability monitoring systems. Our galvanostatic MPPT algorithm ensures continuous and precise tracking achieving superior operational performance for high hysteresis PSCs. The suggested enhancements bear significant implications for the extensive integration of perovskite solar cell technologies, particularly those dependent on power optimizer devices.",

Expansion of renewable electricity supply could allow replacement of many CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emitting technologies with ones that use electricity—in transportation, buildings, and possibly industry. Key elements of the path for California’s electricity sector are: restrain electricity demand through higher efficiency, rapidly expand renewable electricity generation, develop electricity storage to complement renewable electricity, manage flexible electricity loads for a low-carbon electricity system, electrify where appropriate to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and maintain reliable and resilient electricity supply.

            "abstract": "Copper zinc tin sulphide (CZTS) is a p-type semiconductor that can be used as the light absorbing layer in thin-film heterojunction solar cells, with the specific advantage of being comprised only of non-toxic, earth abundant elements. There are many methods through which CZTS can by synthesised, one of which is electrodeposition, which is an industrially scalable process used extensively in the steel industry. This thesis details a study of the electrodeposition of stacked elemental layers and their subsequent sulphurisation in the manufacture of CZTS. A range of electrodeposition parameters are tested for each elemental layer, each of which is characterised through a range of techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), which enables the development of optimised conditions. It was found that the deposition of copper favoured potentiostatic deposition, with a smooth granular structure being deposited onto molybdenum at -0.98V vs Hg|HgO from a sodium hydroxide based electrolyte, while tin required galvanostatic deposition from a methanesulfonic acid electrolyte in order to return consistent results. This was optimised to an initial high current density period of -20 mA cm-2 for 1.2 s to nucleate grains, falling to -5 mA cm-2 to minimise hydrogen evolution thereafter. Trial of numerous electrolyte formulae found that an acid-sulphate electrolyte gave the most promising results, with galvanostatic deposition at -50 mA cm-2 being found to be suitable. Optimised stacked elemental layer precursors are then progressed to the annealing and sulphurisation stage for conversion into CZTS. One key area of study is the inclusion of a pre-alloying annealing step prior to sulphurisation, and its effect on the morphology of the CZTS films and subsequent solar cell device performance. Pre-alloyed metallic films are extensively characterised by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling, X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and EDS elemental mapping as part of an optimisation process, and Raman spectroscopy is used in conjunction with XRD and EDS in the analysis of CZTS films sulphurised in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace. A pre-alloying step at 300 °C for 10 minutes was found to be sufficient for the deposited elements to fully intermix. It was discovered that not only does the inclusion of an optimised pre-alloying step improve the morphology of the CZTS films and the subsequent solar cell performance, but the integration of a pre-alloying stage with the sulphurisation in a single furnace operation does not lead to any evidence of disadvantage when compared with pre-alloying and sulphurisation processes conducted separately. In fact, 8 out of 45 cells with an integrated pre-alloying process achieved 0.1% efficiency or greater, compared to 5 out of 45 for those that underwent a separate pre-alloying process, and 0 out of 45 for those that received no pre-alloying process. This positive result for the integration of the pre-alloy offers simplification of the manufacturing process for a potential future scaled-up CZTS solar cell device.",

This thesis describes a detailed investigation into the design, fabrication and characterisation of Crossed Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CCPC) for photovoltaic application. A set of high-performance CCPCs, which have concentration ratios of 2.9x, 4.0x, 6.0x, 8.3x and 9.0x, respectively, were fabricated using state-of-the-art 3D printing and highly reflective thin-film mirrors. Excellent optical efficiencies from 82.0% to 84.5% were obtained using these concentrators. The angular response of the fabricated concentrators was carried out to provide robust experimental data for the design and optimisation of non-stationary CCPC solar power systems. The experimental results show that the half acceptance angle decreases as the concentration ratio increases, which agrees well with computer simulation using TracePro. The results from a novel rectangular CCPC show that the angular response of the CCPC can be significantly improved with appropriate use of the second reflection, which demonstrates the important role of multiple reflections in the design for highperformance concentrators. The uniformity of light distribution across a PV cell has a significant effect on the power output and stability of the PV cell. It is therefore crucial to ensure the uniformity on the exit aperture of the concentrator. Hence, a systematic study was carried out to determine the appropriate position of the PV cell with reference to the exit aperture of the concentrator. The results show that an optimal position exists for a given concentration ratio, although it varies for different concentration ratios. The optimal value for the concentrators that are investigated in this work ranges from 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm below the exit aperture of the concentrators. A tracking system can be employed to maximise the daily power generation in response to changing positions of the sun during the day. A calculation procedure was developed to determine the minimum tracking movements while obtaining the maximum daily energy production of a CCPC solar power system. The optimal tracking movements for the concentrators investigated in this project were determined using this procedure. The results indicate that a simple and low-cost tracking system is sufficient. Finally, a cost analysis and the potential economic benefit of the developed concentrators are discussed.",

These materials have demonstrated sufficiently high optoelectronic performance to enable commercialization but concerns such as material scarcity limit terawatt level power production.<br>In the continuous pursuit of earth abundant solar absorber materials appropriate for thin film technologies, enargite Cu3AsS4 has been identified as a promising material due to its ideal direct band gap, stability, and high absorption. Recent efforts have demonstrated this class of copper chalcogenides exhibits band gap tunability and has solution processing capabilities for potentially scalable manufacturing. Furthermore, recent first-principles calculations of enargite Cu3AsS4 have hypothesized this material may have high carrier mobility and defect-tolerant optoelectronic properties, which further support investigation into this material. <br><br>In this dissertation, a novel reactive deposition processing route has been developed which has produced dense, single-phase enargite thin films. A champion device efficiency of 0.54% was achieved following a post deposition etching procedure on these films, which demonstrates the density and observable secondary phases were not limiting to initial nanoparticle-based device performances. Together with recent modeling efforts, the non-ideal band alignment with both the back contact and diode junction is concluded to be the primary limiting factor for high efficiency devices. <br><br>As this technology contains arsenic, concerns have been raised about its potential carcinogenicity and toxicity. Similar concerns were raised during the development of cadmium telluride technology, but these concerns have been mitigated through careful life cycle analyses and identifying strategies for responsible life cycle management. Therefore, a life cycle analysis and two risk assessments have been completed on Cu3AsS4 systems. Although emissions of arsenic and its contributions to life cycle impacts are expected to be low due to the small quantity required, hot spots have been identified to reduce waste and emissions. Reduction strategies for this material system are found to be applicable to other PV systems and include minimizing molybdenum sputter waste, reusing and recycling balance of system components, and investigating low-energy processing routes on thin substrates. This work serves to establish a basis on which the potential environmental implications of this thin film technology are understood. <br><br>This dissertation will serve as a guide toward the technical and environmental development of Cu3AsS4 thin films. Having a life cycle perspective during the systematic development of a technology will enable sustainable engineering.

In this study, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to computationally model and screen 1845 halide perovskites in search of new materials without these limitations that are promising for solar cell applications. This study focuses on finding materials that are comprised of nontoxic elements, stable in a humid operating environment, and have an optimal bandgap for one of single junction, tandem Si-perovskite, or quantum dot-based solar cells. Single junction materials are also screened on predicted single junction photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies exceeding 22.7%, which is the current highest reported PV efficiency for halide perovskites. Generally, these methods qualitatively reproduce the properties of known promising nontoxic halide perovskites that have either been experimentally evaluated or predicted from theory. From a set of 1845 materials, 15 materials pass all screening criteria for single junction cell applications, 13 of which have not been previously investigated, such as (CH3NH3)0.75Cs0.25SnI3, ((NH2)2CH)Ag0.5Sb0.5Br3, CsMn0.875Fe0.125I3, ((CH3)2NH2)Ag0.5Bi0.5I3, and ((NH2)2CH)0.5Rb0.5SnI3.

Nevertheless, the characterization of the band tailing in experimental semiconductor crystals is generally difficult. In this article, to determine the tail state generation in various solar cell materials, we have developed a quite general theoretical scheme in which the experimental Urbach energy is compared with the absorption edge energy derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculation. For this purpose, the absorption spectra of solar cell materials, including CdTe, CuInSe2 (CISe), CuGaSe2 (CGSe), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and hybrid perovskites, have been calculated by DFT particularly using very-high-density k meshes. As a result, we find that the tail state formation is negligible in CdTe, CISe, CGSe and hybrid perovskite polycrystals. However, coevaporated CZTSe and CZTS layers exhibit very large Urbach energies, which are far larger than the theoretical counterparts. Based on DFT analysis results, we conclude that the quite large tail state formation observed in the CZTSe and CZTS originates from extensive cation disordering. In particular, even a slight cation substitution is found to generate unusual band fluctuation in CZT(S)Se. In contrast, CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid perovskite shows the sharpest absorption edge theoretically, which agrees with experiment.",

            "abstract": "Hybrid perovskites have received tremendous attention due to their exceptional photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties. Among the two widely used perovskite solar cell device architectures of n-ip and p-i-n, the latter is interesting in terms of its simplicity of fabrication and lower energy input. However this structure mostly uses PEDOT:PSS as a hole transporting layer which can accelerate the perovskite solar cell degradation. Hence the development of stable, inorganic hole extraction layers (HEL), without compromising the simplicity of device fabrication is crucial in this fast-growing photovoltaic field. Here we demonstrate a low temperature (~100 oC) solution - processed and ultrathin (~ 6 nm) NiO nanoparticle thin films as an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We measure a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3 % on rigid glass substrates and 8.5 % on flexible substrates. A comparison with PEDOT:PSS based MAPbI3 solar cells (PCE ~ 7.9 %) shows that NiO based solar cells have higher short circuit current density and improved open circuit voltage (1.03V). Apart from the photovoltaic performance under 1 Sun, the efficient hole extraction property of NiO is demonstrated for indoor lighting as well with a PCE of 23.0 % for NiO based CH3NH3PbI2.9Cl0.1 p-i-n solar cells under compact fluorescent lighting. Compared to the perovskite solar cells fabricated on PEDOT:PSS HEL, better shelf-life stability is observed for perovskite solar cells fabricated on NiO HEL. Detailed microstructural and photophysical investigations imply uniform morphology, lower recombination losses, and improved charge transfer properties for CH3NH3PbI3 grown on NiO HEL.",

By making a simple ansatz for the polarization relaxation, our model is able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively detailed features of measured I-V characteristics. Pre-poling effects are discussed, pointing out the differences between initially over- and under-polarized samples. In particular, the presence of the current over-shoot observed in the reverse characteristics is correlated with the solar cell pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the dynamic hysteresis is analyzed with respect to changing the bias scan rate, the obtained results being consistent with experimentally reported data: the hysteresis amplitude is maximum at intermediate scan rates, while at very slow and very fast ones it becomes negligible. The effects induced by different relaxation time scales are assessed. The proposed dynamic electrical model offers a comprehensive view of the solar cell operation, being a practical tool for future calibration of tentative microscopic descriptions.",

However, their poor stability under exposure to moisture still poses a challenge. In our work, we assigned stability index, power conversion efficiency index, and cost-effectiveness index for each material based on the available experimental data in the literature, and our algorithm determined the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2.1Br0.9/Spiro-OMeTAD as the most well balanced solution in terms of cost, efficiency, and stability.

In this paper, we propose a bilayer heterojunction solar cell comprised of a perovskite layer combining with a IV-VI group semiconductor layer, which can give a conversion efficiency even higher than the conventional perovskite solar cell. Such a scheme uses a property that the semiconductor layer with a direct band gap can be better in absorption of long wavelength light and is complementary to the perovskite layer. We studied the semiconducting layers such as GeSe, SnSe, GeS, and SnS, respectively, and found that GeSe is the best, where the optical absorption efficiency in the perovskite/GeSe solar cell is dramatically increased. It turns out that the short circuit current density is enhanced 100% and the power conversion efficiency is promoted 42.7% (to a high value of 23.77%) larger than that in a solar cell with only single perovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency can be further promoted so long as the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are improved. This strategy opens a new way on developing the solar cells with high performance and practical applications.",

To investigate the specific irradiation damage of 1 MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In and P contents, a simulation based analysis is employed: by fitting the quantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage simultaneously before and after irradiation, the induced changes in lifetime are detected. Furthermore, the reduction of irradiation damage during regeneration under typical satellite operating conditions for GEO missions (60°C and AM0 illumination) is investigated. A clear decrease of the radiation damage is observed after post irradiation regeneration. This regeneration effect is stronger for increasing InP-fraction. It is demonstrated that the irradiation induced defect recombination coefficient for irradiation with 1 MeV electrons after regeneration for 216 hours can be described with a linear function of InP-fraction between 1*10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/s for GaAs and 7*10$^{-7}$ cm$^2$/s for InP. The results show that GaInAsP is a promising material for radiation hard space solar cells.",

We use these relations to test the flux-transport solar dynamo theory and to explain some well known characteristics of the solar cycle.

His recorded observations and science results, as well as the work carried out by other following outstanding Italian astronomers inspired the start of institutional programs of regular solar observations at the Arcetri, Catania, and Rome Observatories. These programs have accumulated daily images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere taken at various spectral bands over a time span greater than 80 years. In the last two decades, regular solar observations were continued with digital cameras only at the Catania and Rome Observatories, which are now part of the INAF National Institute for Astrophysics. At the two sites, daily solar images are taken at the photospheric G-band, Blue ($λ=409.4$ nm), and Red ($λ=606.9$ nm) continua spectral ranges and at the chromospheric Ca II K and H$α$ lines, with a $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ spatial resolution. Solar observation in Italy, which benefits from over 2500 hours of yearly sunshine, currently aims at the operational monitoring of solar activity and long-term variability and at the continuation of the historical series as well. Existing instruments will be soon enriched by the SAMM double channel telescope equipped with magneto-optical filters that will enable the tomography of the solar atmosphere with simultaneous observations at the K I 769.9 nm and Na I D 589.0 nm lines. In this contribution, we present the available observations and outline their scientific relevance.",

In this regime the standard slow-roll condition |m^2| &lt;&lt; H^2 is violated. Nevertheless, this stage can be rather long if |m| is sufficiently small. Fast-roll inflation can be useful for generating proper initial conditions for the subsequent stage of slow-roll inflation in the very early universe. It may also be responsible for the present stage of accelerated expansion of the universe. We also make two observations of a more general nature. First of all, the universe after a long stage of inflation (either slow-roll or fast-roll) cannot reach anti-de Sitter regime even if the cosmological constant is negative. Secondly, the theories with the potentials with a \"stable\" minimum at V(φ)&lt;0 in the cosmological background exhibit the same instability as the theories with potentials unbounded from below. This instability leads to the development of singularity with the properties practically independent of V(φ). However, the development of the instability in some cases may be so slow that the theories with the potentials unbounded from below can describe the present stage of cosmic acceleration even if this acceleration occurs due to the fast-roll inflation.",

The numerous advantages that increasingly distinguish them from traditional light sources, such as a large and customizable emission area, color tunability, flexibility, and transparency, have positioned them as a promising candidate for various applications in the lighting market, including the residential, automotive, industrial, and agricultural sectors. However, despite these promising attributes, the widespread industrial production of OLEDs encounters significant challenges. Key considerations center around efficiency and lifetime. In the present review, after introducing the theoretical basis of OLEDs and summarizing the main performance developments in the industrial field, three crucial aspects enabling OLEDs to establish a competitive advantage in terms of performance and versatility are critically discussed: the quality and stability of the emitted light, with a specific focus on white light and its tunability; the transparency of both electrodes for the development of fully transparent and integrable devices; and the uniformity of emission over a large area.",

In traditional OPVs, the random bulk heterojunction leads to inefficient exciton transport because the exciton diffusion length is often shorter than the phase separation scale. By applying DNA nanostructures, researchers can create a highly ordered 'antenna' system that facilitates directed Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) toward the charge-separation interface. This would specifically solve the problem of low exciton diffusion lengths (typically 10-20nm) and could significantly increase the internal quantum efficiency of carbon-based solar cells by ensuring every absorbed photon has a clear, directed path to the junction.",

By structuring the semiconductor lattice at the nanoscale to create phononic bandgaps (a technique from acoustic metamaterials), one can selectively suppress the specific vibrational modes responsible for electron cooling. This would allow for the extraction of high-energy electrons before they cool, potentially enabling the cell to bypass the Shockley-Queisser limit and approach the theoretical Carnot efficiency of solar conversion (~85%).",

In this Review, we outline notable achievements that have been made in these photovoltaic-integrated technologies.

By applying DNA nanostructures, researchers can create a highly ordered 'antenna' system that facilitates directed Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) toward the charge-separation interface. This would specifically solve the problem of low exciton diffusion lengths (typically 10-20nm) and could significantly increase the internal quantum efficiency of carbon-based solar cells by ensuring every absorbed photon has a clear, directed path to the junction.",

One of the primary losses in conventional PV is the thermalization of 'hot' carriers (electrons with energy far above the bandgap) which lose energy as heat via acoustic phonon emission within picoseconds. By structuring the semiconductor lattice at the nanoscale to create phononic bandgaps (a technique from acoustic metamaterials), one can selectively suppress the specific vibrational modes responsible for electron cooling. This would allow for the extraction of high-energy electrons before they cool, potentially enabling the cell to bypass the Shockley-Queisser limit and approach the theoretical Carnot efficiency of solar conversion (~85%).",

Currently, long-term stability testing for new PV materials takes years. By applying ML models trained on the rich, multi-cycle electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of batteries, researchers can identify the 'early warning' signatures of ion migration and redox instability in solar cell stacks. Specifically, this allows for the rapid screening of encapsulated materials by correlating 100-hour accelerated stress tests with 25-year lifetime predictions, solving the primary bottleneck to the commercialization of perovskite technologies.",
