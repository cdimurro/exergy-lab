  "renewable_accounting_note": "For renewables, efficiency depends on how 'primary energy' is counted. IEA uses different methods: (1) Physical energy content method for hydro/wind/solar PV counts electricity output directly, making them appear ~100% efficient at generation. (2) We apply modest factors to account for T&D and end-use losses, plus accounting method adjustments."
